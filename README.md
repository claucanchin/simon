# simon

Simon is named after the simple children's game of Simon Says. A round in the game consists of the buttons lighting up in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by clicking the buttons in the same sequence. As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be clicked increases. If the user succeeds, the series become progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over. (The user may be able to win at level 20.)

#### Build Simon (User Story)
As a user, 
- I can see four buttons (clockwise: green, red, blue, yellow)
- I can click on a start button that does a count down of "3, 2, 1..." before the button lights up
- I can see the order of buttons that light up (with audio) that I have to reproduce
- I have to reproduce the colors within the same time that the sequence was shown
- I can see the level displayed and updated after every round
- if I miss a round, I am told that I have lost
- if I have lost, I will be asked to restart

### Ideas for Further
- Add shorter time intervals (i.e. the lights flash faster)
- Add another color
- Rotate the placement of the buttons
- Use keyboard as input instead of clicking
