# simon

Simon is named after the simple children's game of Simon Says. A round in the game consists of the buttons lighting up in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by clicking the buttons in the same sequence. As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be clicked increases. If the user succeeds, the series become progressively longer and more complex. 

Click Start to see the first button light up. Each Level corresponds with the number of buttons that will play (i.e. Level 3: 3 buttons will light up). In this game, your only defeat is your lack of patience.
